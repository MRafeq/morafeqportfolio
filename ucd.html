        <p>
          User-Centered Design (UCD) prioritizes users' needs. Through UCD, I gained valuable skills in user research and crafting intuitive interfaces. In media design, I conducted interviews and tests to understand users' media habits. This informed the creation of an engaging interface that aligned with their preferences, resulting in high satisfaction. UCD's iterative process allowed for early feedback and improvements, enhancing usability and visual appeal. UCD taught me the importance of user research in creating impactful media design experiences.

            <p>
              For our initial group assignment, we selected a company and explored its positive and negative aspects. In order to accomplish this, we utilized research surveys and conducted interviews with friends and students, employing various methods from the CMD toolkit. These approaches helped us achieve our objective and obtain insightful findings.<br>

            </p>
            <div class="content">
            <p>              
              
              <span>Company analysis:</span><br>
              We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the company's products, services, history, culture, and customer base. We delved into the company's website, social media channels, financial reports, and news articles. To gain additional insights, we interviewed friends and students who had interacted with the company. This multifaceted analysis provided us with a holistic understanding of the company.<br>
              
              <span>Surveys:</span> <br>
              To gather feedback on individuals' experiences with the company, we designed and distributed surveys among our friends and fellow students. By collecting their responses, we were able to capture a wide range of perspectives and evaluate satisfaction levels.<br>
              
              <span>Interviews: </span><br>
              In addition to surveys, we conducted in-depth interviews with our friends and students who had personal experiences with the company. These interviews allowed us to gather detailed information, enabling us to gain deeper insights into their interactions, opinions, and suggestions for improvement.<br>
              
             <span> Persona creation:</span> <br>
              To further enhance our understanding of the users' needs and preferences, we created a persona based on the collected data. This fictional representation helped us empathize with the target audience and design solutions that catered to their specific requirements.<br>
              
              By utilizing these CMD methods, engaging with friends and students, and creating a persona, we successfully assessed the company's strengths and weaknesses. These activities provided us with valuable insights into the user experience, enabling us to propose meaningful improvements and solutions.

              <h1>Mind Map</h1>
              <p>Mind maps are dynamic visual diagrams that capture and organize ideas, concepts, and tasks. Developed by Tony Buzan, they mimic the brain's natural thought processes, encouraging whole-brain thinking and enhancing memory retention. With their non-linear structure, mind maps foster creativity, aid problem-solving, and facilitate effective organization of complex information. This introduction provides a glimpse into the power of mind maps as a tool for unlocking creativity and boosting productivity.</p>

          <p>For our project website, I embarked on an exciting research journey to explore new ideas and improve the user experience. Through a combination of interviews and online research, I aimed to address user needs and make our website even better. I conducted three interviews with individuals of different backgrounds and online shopping experience to gather valuable insights on the proposed feature of adding quantity control icons on the product page. Additionally, I delved into online resources to learn about best practices and user expectations. By blending interview findings with online research, I gained a comprehensive understanding of the benefits and feasibility of implementing the proposed extension. In the research pdf, I present my methodology, interview findings, and emphasize the significance of the proposed extension based on user needs. My aim is to highlight the potential impact of this extension on enhancing the overall user experience of our project website</p>

        <h1>Extension Part-Two</h1>
        <p>This research paper presents an iterative development process for a website prototype, focusing on enhancing the user experience through the implementation of quantity control icons on the product page. By following user-centered design principles, the aim was to create a refined and user-friendly interface. This paper documents the steps taken, including the creation of a paper prototype, user testing, iterative improvements, and the development of a clickable prototype using Figma. The research highlights the importance of incorporating user feedback in the design process and demonstrates the iterative nature of creating effective website experiences.</p>
